Quizzlet is a web-based quiz game that helps users play against several random quizzes. Each page contains five quiz questions, with only the first one visible to the player. The second question becomes visible only after the player selects one of the options of the first question. After an option is selected, the other options are automatically disabled. This allows players to focus on one question at a time and helps them avoid getting overwhelmed by too many options at once. Quizzlet is an engaging and challenging way for users to test their knowledge and improve their skills in a variety of subjects.
